Volume 1 - Setup

Use American dialect and the serial comma and scoring.
The maximum score is 400.
Include Basic Screen Effects by Emily Short.
Include Hitchhiker Actions by Scott Vandehey.

[--------------------------------------]

Book 1 - When Play Begins

After printing the banner text when not requesting the story file version, say "[paragraph break]You wake up. The room is spinning very gently round your head. Or at least it would be if you could see it which you can't."

[Return the Thing]
When play begins:
	the gift returns in 21 turns from now.

[Wreck the House]
When play begins:
	the house is wrecked in 20 turns from now.

[--------------------------------------]

Book 2 - When Play Ends

Rule for printing the player's obituary: 
	say "We are about to give you your score. Put on your peril-sensitive sunglasses now. (Hit RETURN or ENTER when ready.)[paragraph break]";
	wait for any key;
	say "Your score is [score] of a possible [maximum score], in [turn count] turn[s].";
	rule succeeds.

[--------------------------------------]

Book 3 - Variables

[Setting a global variable for the current topic is a fairly convoluted way to handle this. Modern Inform would probably just use a topic table, but I'm converting from the HHG2G ZIL code, which, perhaps as a memory-saving technique, recycles many replies across various situations, so it was easier to preserve their existing "when X happens, the topic number is Y" logic, which I've translated below into the conversation actions.]
The current topic is a number that varies.

[--------------------------------------]

Book 4 - Timers

[Reset the Current Topic]
At the time when the current topic resets:
	now the current topic is 0;

[Wreck the House]
At the time when the house is wrecked:
	if the player is in the bed or the player is in the bedroom or the player is in the front porch:
		say "Astoundingly, [a bulldozer] pokes through your wall. However, you have no time for surprise because the ceiling is collapsing on you as [better-luck]";
		end the story;

[Reset wreck the house timer if player re-enters the house]
After going north from the front garden:
	the house is wrecked in 5 turns from now;
	continue the action;

[--------------------------------------]

Book 5 - New Kinds of Things

A tool is a kind of thing.

An owned thing is a kind of thing. An owned thing has some text called the owner.

[--------------------------------------]

Book 6 - Body Parts

A body part is a kind of thing.

Understand "your" as a thing when the item described is held by the person asked.

[Ears]

Your ears are a body part. They are part of the player. Understand "ear" as your ears.

Your hand is a body part. It is part of the player. Understand "hands" as your hand.
