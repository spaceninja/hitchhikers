Part 1 - Bedroom

The Bedroom is a dark room. "The bedroom is a mess. It is a small bedroom with a faded carpet and old wallpaper. There is a washbasin, a chair with a tatty dressing gown slung over it, and a window with the curtains drawn. Near the exit leading south is a phone."

Chapter 1 - Door

The bedroom door is an open scenery door. It is south of the Bedroom and north of the Front Porch.

[Because the door can only be in one direction, but we want to treat south, out, and down as all going to the porch, we need to redirect the player through the door]

Instead of going down from the Bedroom, try going south. Instead of going outside from the Bedroom, try going south.

Instead of going up from the Front Porch, try going north. Instead of going inside from the Front Porch, try going north.

Chapter 2 - Scenery

The bed is an enterable scenery supporter in the Bedroom. The player is on the bed.

The stuff-under-bed is scenery in the bedroom. "That's not important; leave it alone." Understand "book", "coin", "coins", "handkerchief", "handkerchiefs", "soiled", "foreign" as the stuff-under-bed.

Your curtains are scenery in the bedroom. Understand "your", "curtain", "shade", "shades" as your curtains.

[Prevent doing things from bed]

[Get out of bed message]

After getting off the bed, say "Very difficult, but you manage it. The room is still spinning. It dips and sways a little."

[Looking under the bed]

Instead of looking under the bed, say "There's nothing there. Well, there are a few soiled handkerchiefs, a book you thought you'd lost, a couple of foreign coins, and something else which can't be fully described in a family game, but nothing you'd actually want."

Instead of doing anything other than examining to the stuff-under-bed, try examining the stuff-under-bed.
